# Chatzilla

Chatzilla is a realtime messaging app with a bit of oldschool chatroom flair that pairs a React client with a Rails API. 

**Hosted at**: https://chatzilla-front-end.onrender.com/

## Key Features
- **Authentication** – Sign‑up, sign‑in, and sign‑out handled by Devise; CSRF tokens are fetched automatically.
- **Room Creation** - Users can create chatrooms based on their interests, which other users can join.
- **Realtime Messaging** - Users can send messages within rooms they have joined, and messages are delivered instantly via ActionCable.
- **Presence Tracking and Toggling** - Online status is stored in Redis and broadcast to all users. Users can toggle between displaying themselves as online/offline by clicking a button.
- **Content Moderation via Neutrino** - Usernames, room names and descriptions, and message content are all checked through the Neutrino API and inappropriate submissions are rejected.
- **Responsive UI** – Off‑canvas navigation panel lists rooms and users and provides a “Create Room” modal. Bootstrap and custom styles ensure mobile friendliness.
- **Account Deletion** - Users can freely delete their account and any messages they've sent by clicking on their user page (however, note that this will *not* delete any rooms they've created).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend** - React + Bootstrap
- **Backend** - Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, ActionCable, Devise
- **Utilities** - HTTParty, MSW (tests), ESLint/Prettier, Neutrino (content moderation)
- **Testing** - Vitest, Rspect, Cypress (work in progress)

## Future Improvements
- Approval requirement for joining private rooms
- Ability to edit room names and descriptions after creation
- Ability to edit usernames
- Allow sign-in via Google, Facebook, etc.
- Incorporation of images (for user avatars and messages); will require expanding content moderation
